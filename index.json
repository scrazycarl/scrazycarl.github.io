Surviving one of the most serious disaster in human history, his book presented detailed his physical and mental suffer in several concentration Nazi\u0026rsquo;s concentration camps. With his surviving off the camp, he proves that in whatever condition a mankind face, even the worst possible one, there is still encoded freedom and dignity in human nature. However dim a man\u0026rsquo;s life can be, there is always a meaning to it.\nFrankl was an established psychiatrist by the beginning of 1940. Parallel to the Freud and Adler, Victor is the representative of the third school of psychiatry theory: Logotherapy. He showed his talent in a young age and studied with both Freud and Adler, he didn\u0026rsquo;t agree with either school of psychology. He firmly believed that human life is not centered by the pursuit of happiness nor the pursuit of superiority. Instead, the central thesis of human\u0026rsquo;s life is a meaning. With some years of practice, he further developed the theory and started to write a book.\nBefore he was taken in to Auschwitz in 1940, he was already established and running a clinic in Vienna, which still took Jewish people. When Nazis suddenly appeared at his door and took him to the camp, he had the manuscript of the book with him. Little did he know, the only asset he could preserve in the camp is his bare body. Yet it is still the luckiest case.\nGoing through of the worst condition one could imagine and survived with sheer luck, in this book, Frankl breaks down the three phases of mental struggle that a typical prisoner goes through. Everyone who wasn\u0026rsquo;t sent to the gas chamber still faced a tough mental challenge with extreme weather and physical conditions to preserve mental sanity. Once the belief of survival is gone, disease will soon conquer the very weak body and take away once\u0026rsquo;s life.\nIt is in this extreme condition, Frankl proved his theory by holding up to the belief that all these suffering will have a meaning and his life has a meaning. With this strong belief, not only did he survived concentration camps, he also lived a long life until 92 years old. When was taken to the camp, he was 35. Five years would passed when he survived and it also took away his wife, brother, and both parents. He would never made it out and had an impactful life until 92, if he hadn\u0026rsquo;t hold on to the strong purpose he chose for himself.\nSeeing him overcoming all the psychological challenges gives the reader a sense of confirm and encouragement, to boldly pursue one\u0026rsquo;s purpose without any hesitations. As one of my favorite excerpt from the book says:\n Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.\n ","date":1594062708,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594062708,"objectID":"b98cd3346945e39b9e94433fb65b91a2","permalink":"https://shirzart.github.io/blog/a-life-with-purpose/","publishdate":"2020-07-06T21:11:48+02:00","relpermalink":"/blog/a-life-with-purpose/","section":"post","summary":"The learnings from the book 'Man's' search for meaning","tags":["book review"],"title":"A life with purpose ","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shirzart"],"categories":["Design Thinking"],"content":"Do you like wondering about big ideas from now and then, but don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be useful someday? Well most of us might had a day or two where you think about another way of going to school, taking classes, commuting in the cities or just having a different memory system or anything, like the kind of future scenario that none of the science fiction wrote about it, yet its so intriguing. The joy of indulging myself in the wonderland of imagination is always so liberating. Yet most of these things never make a stop further than being forgotten at the back of your brain.\nSometimes, I also enjoy building things from scratch. Unlike the most geeky kids who started out with computer programming at early age, my earliest building projects were all kinds of Mini models that compose a great toy after being built. There was a time when a Japanese Anime about miniature 4WD was viral in Urumqi. I spent numerous evenings of my primary school days to build them. The joy of composing something that\u0026rsquo;s working was unparalleled. I would easily spent 2 hours without thinking about anything else to try to finish the project.\nHowever, it was not very easy most of the time to combine those joys together. The joy of thinking wildly and the joy of making something happen. The mismatch between the magnificat scale of envision and the limited power of implementation without technology was the limiting factor.\nWhat if, there is something that make the gap between imagination and implementation so small that it won\u0026rsquo;t even stop you from doing it?\nThen you might what to know design thinking.\nHave both: Wild ideas + Fast implementation + Iterative improvement = Design Thinking Design Thinking literally means the thinking process used by designers when they create a new concept. It is a perfect tool to utilize your big ideas and generate innovative solutions. It\u0026rsquo;s maybe not the first framework to encourage fast implementation, nor wild ideas, nor iterative improvement. But the combination of these elements makes it an organic process for the solution and the problem to co-evolve, while delivering the solution that user never realized wanted. It\u0026rsquo;s like delivering a car when the client says \u0026ldquo;I just want a faster horse.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the three elements: wild ideas, fast implementation, and iterative improvement interplay in the process, it\u0026rsquo;s not forseeable which ideas you will have and what implementation is it. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to know what element of technology you want to add, however, before implemented, no one knows what will come up.\nSo how does design thinking actually work?\nBlank canvas to brilliant ideas: be open, test your assumption, be flexible The key to have a successful design thinking session is to always be open to new ideas and be suspicious about the assumptions you make about the user. All these key elements are wrapped in an interactive session that is very well described by 2 diamond. Though there are different ways to represent the design thinking process, we developed this concept of 2 diamonds during InCube project.\nWhile the whole design thinking process breaks down into problem space and solution space, each spaces are made of a diverging process where you brainstrom ideas and be open-minded and a converging process where you examine your assumptions by using testing method such as rapid prototyping, etc. The key in the converging face is to be flexible and not fix your mind on an existing solutions. Moreover, the quality of diverging phase also set a tone of how innovative your solutions can be. The more open-minded you are, the more surprise you will find in the end.There are lot of techniques go into the process of testing and validating assumptions, which will not be discussed in detail here.\nNevertheless, the design thinking process is never a one time project. The whole process could be repeated iteratively for as many times as you need when time is not a problem. The real joy I find in the process is when I can be as wild as I want in brainstorming, while being as rigorous as I can achieve in testing the assumptions and developing solutions. There is intellectual joy hidden in the making of a great idea or MVP.\nI guess this is why I ❤️ Design Thinking :)\n","date":1591905486,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591905486,"objectID":"6728e06b79ee70f9f7dd47e8c4e58cf2","permalink":"https://shirzart.github.io/blog/the-beauty-of-design-thinking/","publishdate":"2020-06-11T21:58:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/blog/the-beauty-of-design-thinking/","section":"post","summary":"Why I loved design thinking and how to get into it","tags":["Design Thinking"],"title":"The Beauty of Design Thinking","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shirzart"],"categories":[],"content":"Last year, during this time, I was sprinting my last month of work for my master thesis. At that time, I had the general impression that the result would be rather good. One month after that I finished my master thesis and submitted it. From the beginning of my thesis work, I had a clear goal in mind to obtain a great grade for it.\nI finished my thesis one month later. To this day, I still remember when I walked into the assistant’s office, I felt quite anxious. My heart was beating fast as if I had missed something crucial. However, when I tried to calm down and go through the details, I couldn’t find anything that would have explained my anxiety.\nTwo to three months later, I finally received my grade. It was waaayyy lower than my expectation. I just couldn’t make my head around it, because even my supervisor was saying “great job”, “well done” in most of the meetings when we talk about the result of my thesis.\nIn retrospect, my thesis wasn’t perfect. Something could have been done differently. One of the biggest reasons that I received a low grade was: “He works hard and fast, but without a plan.” Although I had a plan at that time, it turns out I still failed my thesis to my standard.\nIf I had the chance to do it differently, I would rethink it on the following 6 aspects:\n1. Have a plan and manage it correctly At the beginning of my thesis, I had a kickoff meeting with my supervisor about the thesis work. Except for talking about technical details, the most important thing they told me was to have a plan to secure the success of my thesis.\nAnd I did.\nI had weekly plans like the following:\nThe note of each week contained a summary from the previous week and a plan for the current week:\nHowever, with all these plans implemented, My supervisor still had the impression that I didn’t have a plan. It means something went wrong in my execution. Having a plan doesn’t guarantee success. You need to be able to execute it, measure it, reflect on each week’s process, and improve on it.\nManaging a master thesis is actually a project management task. Implementing a proper project management scheme would actually be beneficial. Between the most widely used project management scheme, implementing a waterfall project management could be really helpful. Because the scope and cost are defined before the thesis. Even though the goal of the thesis may be adjusted along the way in some cases, most often the scope is predefined and you need to guarantee success.\nCompared to my weekly reflection and planning method above, waterfall project management can give you a good overview of the workload distribution in each week, help you adjust your plan when there is still time left, and let you control the cost. All of this is possible because of the Gantt chart – the main tool used for waterfall project management.\nIf I could do my thesis again, I would manage it better using waterfall project management.\n2. Keep a balance between being independent and seeking guidance. I graduated from one of the best universities in Europe, a place where they always encourage you to ask questions. As we all know, “There are no dumb questions”. While being curious and inquisitive will definitely help you in the class, when working on a project with supervisors, you need to keep a good balance.\nEntering my thesis work, I was determined reach the goal I had proposed when I started my thesis and to learn from it as much as I can. Through out my thesis progress, I was always trying to be communicative and ask questions to my supervisors about my progress, my working method and how should I improve.\nHowever, these questions sometimes were not only about my thesis design and execution, but I also asked some technical trick in programming and algorithms to expand my knowledge. I thought this would leave a good impression.\nIn the end, I also received a comment from my supervisor saying “Sometimes, he needs too much help”. It’s understandable that your supervisors also have a lot of other responsibilities. Bothering them too much will leave an impression of not being independent enough.\nIf I could have done it one more time, I would restrain myself from asking questions that are not relevant for my thesis.\n3. Writing style and perfection A great thesis comes with great academic writing skills. This might have been my weakest point throughout my thesis work. My department considers a good thesis to be no longer than 30 pages, not including the appendix. Some people chose to write a complex appendix to showcase all the results, while I chose to write a brief thesis and only put in relevant content to the appendix.\nWriting your thesis in a concise way was challenging. In the end, the content of my thesis was 26 pages. I went through 3 rounds of correction with my supervisors before the hand-in.\nHowever, a crucial mistake I made there was adding or changing content the night before the submission.\nThis ended up costing me a lot since many mistakes came from these last minute changes. I was just not confident enough to leave it and hand in the next day. For different people, it might work differently, but I had more than once experience that changing the content in the last minute costs me more than the value brought by that change.\n4. Communication and Expectation management Another myth that hit me very hard after I got the result of my thesis is the difference between reality and expectation. Throughout my thesis work, I felt that 80% of the feedback I received was positive feedback, like “Good job” , “Well done”, and “You have the potential to write an excellent grade”. However, there was negative feedback too, when I underperformed for my second midterm presentation. They told me about their disappointment and frustration about some persistent spelling mistakes. But it didn’t sound too negative for me and I could not feel the strong disappointment as they did. This ended up costing me a lot.\nNext time, when collaborating with a person who is going to grade me, I would definitely have a meeting with them and align everyone’s expectations. Most importantly, I would be careful on not to indulge my self on positive feedback. The best way to manage expectations is to align the criteria and the final goal. If I had been more explicit and aligned my goal with my supervisor, the result would have turned out differently.\n5. Motivation source: find the intrinsic motivation, not external stimulus While it might not too much room to discuss where the motivation should come from when you are doing aster thesis, since a grade will be given directly from the supervisors as an evaluation. You will inherently have a big motivation to please them. But the disadvantages of this mechanism are, you may stop to progress at a point that is enough to meet your supervisors\u0026rsquo; expectation, while most of the time, an excellent piece of work goes beyond expectations.\nWhenever possible, you should seek intrinsic motivation within yourself. You need to own your project, own your thesis, and your work by setting your goal, your expectation and motivate yourself with less external incentives but more with internal incentives. Only in this way, you won\u0026rsquo;t rest at a sudo-perfect solution, but always pursuing a better result. Freeing yourself from other people’s expectations and instead striving to meet our own needs, would be the most independent long term motivation that drives us safe and far.\nI learned this only after my thesis, after a tearful and heart-breaking meeting.\nI wish I could have done my thesis in all these different ways :)\n","date":1589317414,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589317414,"objectID":"031ac473187affab9eb0ea7493395c7b","permalink":"https://shirzart.github.io/blog/learning-from-my-master-thesis/","publishdate":"2020-05-12T23:03:34+02:00","relpermalink":"/blog/learning-from-my-master-thesis/","section":"post","summary":"Reflect on my working method and result from master thesis","tags":[],"title":"Learning from my master thesis","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Background information Global warming is a well-sound alarm occupying the news everyday, before the corona hit us. The most relatable source of pollution or contribution for an average joe might be the black smoke coming out of the chimney from nearby power plant. Indeed, coal-fired power plant is one of the main contributor to emission of green house gases, but what is little know to many people is, it\u0026rsquo;s not only green house gases being emitted by power plant. Sometimes it also contains heavy metal pollutants,for example, mercury.\nBut from all the emission happened from global power plants, how much mercury emission happened every year? After they are emitted, how would they distribute globally? While, if it\u0026rsquo;s really bad, what can we do to reduce it? How well the effect of reduction be?\nThere has been some studies investigating in this question, but it\u0026rsquo;s still rather new. My thesis project was then focusing on answering those questions by 1) modelling the mercury emission 2) Calculating the mercury gaseous concentration distribution globally, 3) Purpose the mitigation strategy and model the effect after the mitigation strategy.\nWhat is given? Before starting the work, I used an existing model, developed by the lab that I worked for, to calculate global mercury emission. Another model which is co-developed in the lab for calculating gaseous mercury concentration distribution is used to calculate the global mercury concentration distribution.\nGoal  Model the mercury emission scenario.  An emission calculation model was developed by Ecosystem Design Lab. I use this to calculate global mercury emission. Comparison by visualization : I needed to reproduce a similar visualization in R and compare it to original visualization, without knowing what program or how the visualization was generated in the reference.   Propose mitigation strategy to reduce mercury pollution:  Propose strategy on a global scale to reduce global mercury emission and concentration. Compare the result by visualization   Study the effect of mitigation strategy on a local scale  Result of the study  Compare the produced visualisation with reference. Present the global and local change with the same visualisation scale. Discuss the pro and cons of visual comparison  1. Compare the reproduced visualization of data and graph Plot from reference:\nPlot from me:\nThe original plot is probabaly generated in MATLAB. I used R to best mimic the visualisation to help me compare how good is our computation method, compared to the reference.\nFrom the general color representation, it could be seen that my visualisation was very close to the original one. Keep in mind that the computation method is also different. So it will result in actual different value in some cells.\n2.1 Global change of mercury concentration after mitigation This graphs shows what would mercury concentration in the air be if the emission we have is like in year 2000.\nThis graph shows, the scenario where some technologies are adapted to reduce the emission in 2010 and what would the mercury concentration in the air be in 2060.\nDistribution of global power plants 2.2 Global mercury concentration change after upgrading To reduce the mercury emission and resulting concentration in the air, two different methods are purposed to apply technology upgrade to a selection of power plants. The following graph display the results of this technology upgrade.\nBoth graphs display the percentage decrease of mercury concentration in the air.\nThe effect of using A technology The effect of using B technology 3. Discussion of visualisation method In this project, I mainly implemented the visualization scheme presented above. The aim is to compare the changes directly with the \u0026ldquo;same\u0026rdquo; color scale and unit in each graph. Since the original color scale was not clearly presented in the reference (see the first graph), I had to emulate the color scale as close as possible using R package. The advantage of using the same color scale is :\n Two graphs can be compared together directly. The numerical change is linearly mapped to color change. The consistency through out the project makes it easier to understand the changes in each scenario.  The disadvantages are:\n The color scale used here is not necessarily color blind friendly. Although the numerical changes are mapped to color changes, sometimes its not strong enough to produce or spot a color change.
